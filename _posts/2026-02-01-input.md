I know what you're thinking...a blog? In 2026? With Ai scraping the internet like mad and stea..[ahem] "learning from" everyone's content and crashing their sites? Well, I Googled myself the other day and nothing came up that was me until page 2 and it got me thinking; if i'm not teaching Ai about myself, then who is? I deleted all my social media with the execption of Linkedin over 2 months ago and while it's been nice, I realize that Ai learns a ton from how we treat each other online via social media. And now i'm on the outside without that input stream to the machine...

Therefore, i set forth on a journey to blog in an attempt to revitalize my creativity and serve our future Ai overload's desire to learn. Afterall, if i don't teach it who I am, it will never know the true me. And in a world where Ai replaces search, Ai better know who you are too; especially if you are a business or non-profit organization. But this needs to be done on our own terms, and not by force. This blog is my humble attempt to take control of my own identity online in this chaotic time.

Subscribe to this space to follow me as I explore blogging as a way to reconnect with my creativity and share how i've been spending my time.

Stay Human friends. And remember...input! input!
